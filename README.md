# Convex + TypeScript + ESLint + Vite + React + Clerk + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

This template provides a minimal setup to get Convex working, with TypeScript,
ESLint and React using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It uses [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) for user authentication.

Start by editing `convex/myFunctions.ts` and interact with your React app.

See Convex docs at https://docs.convex.dev/home

## Setting up

```
npm create convex@latest -t react-vite-clerk-shadcn
```

Then:

1. Follow steps 1 to 3 in the [Clerk onboarding guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#get-started)
2. Paste the Issuer URL as `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` to your dev deployment environment variable settings on the Convex dashboard (see [docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances))
3. Paste your publishable key as `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<your publishable key>"` to the `.env.local` file in this directory.

If you want to sync Clerk user data via webhooks, check out this [example repo](https://github.com/thomasballinger/convex-clerk-users-table/).

EDIT (by the author):

Created with `npm create convex@latest` (React, Vite, Clerk).

Add this in `tailwind.config.ts`...
```
import animate from "tailwindcss-animate";
...
plugins: [animate],
```
instead of...
```
...
plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate")],
```

Added TanStack Router with `npm install @tanstack/react-router`.
Vite Plugin and TSR Devtools: `npm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin @tanstack/router-devtools`.
